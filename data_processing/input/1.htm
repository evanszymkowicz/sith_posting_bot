<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to
outlying star systems is in dispute. Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the
greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo. While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of
events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the
guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict...</p>

<p>PAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great
speed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads toward the beautiful green planet of
Naboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships.</p>
<p>INT REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT</p>
<p>In the cockpit of the cruise, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver closer to one of
the battleships.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: (off screen voice) Captain.</p>
<p>The Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: Yes, sir?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: (V.O) Tell them we wish to board at once.</p>
<p>The CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a Neimoidian trade
viceroy, waits for a reply.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: With all due respect, the Ambassadors for the Supreme
Chancellor wish to board immediately.</p>
<p>NUTE: Yes, yes, of course... as you know, our blockade is perfectly
legal, and we'd be happy to receive the Ambassador.</p>
<p>The screen goes black. Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship looms
ever closer.</p>
<p>EXT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE (FX)</p>
<p>The small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation
battleship.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE</p>
<p>A PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking bay.</p>
<p>The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay. Two
darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.</p>
<p>TC-14: I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.</p>
<p>They move off down the hallway.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM</p>
<p>A door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST CAMERA into the
formal conference room by TC-14.</p>
<p>TC-14: We are greatly honored by your visit Ambassadors. Make yourselves
comfortable. My master will be with you shortly.</p>
<p>The droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI-GON JINN. She backs out the door
and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window at the
lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON forty years old, has long brown hair in a
ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is twenty five, with
very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I don't sense anything.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: It's not about the mission, Master, it's something...
elsewhere... elusive.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan. Keep your
concentration here and now where it belongs.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: But Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...</p>
<p>QUI-GON: ... but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the
living Force, my young Padawan.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Yes, Master.</p>
<p>They walk over to the window and gaze out into space.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: (cont'd) How do you think the trade viceroy will deal with
the chancellor's demands?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be
short.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</p>
<p>NUTE GUNRAY and DAULTRAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC-14.</p>
<p>NUTE: (shaken) What?!? What did you say?</p>
<p>TC-14: The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.</p>
<p>DOFINE: I knew it! They're here to force a settlement.</p>
<p>NUTE: Distract them. I will contact Lord Sidious.</p>
<p>DOFINE: Are you brain dead? I'm not going in there with two Jedi! Send
the droid.</p>
<p>DOFINE turns to TC-14, who lets out a squeaky sigh.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM</p>
<p>QUI-GON and OBI-WAN sit at the large conference table.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Is it in their nature to make us wait this long?</p>
<p>The door to the conference room slides open, and TC-14 enters with a tray of
drinks and food.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: No... I sense an unusual amount of fear for something as
trivial as this trade dispute.</p>
<p>TC-14 walks over to OBI-WAN who takes a drink. The droid then walks over to
QUI-GON who takes a drink as TC-14 leaves the room.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</p>
<p>NUTE, DOFINE, and RUNE HAAKO are before the hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS, a
robed figure whose face is obscured by a hood.</p>
<p>DARTH SIDIOUS: What is it?</p>
<p>DOFINE: ... This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious. The
blockade is finished! We dare not go against these Jedi.</p>
<p>DARTH SIDIOUS: Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slim in my sight
again.</p>
<p>NUTE gives DOFINE a stern look and DOFINE bows his head in shame as he turns
and walks away.</p>
<p>DARTH SIDIOUS: This turn of events is unfortunate. We must accelerate
our plans. Begin landing your troops.</p>
<p>NUTE: My Lord, is that... legal?</p>
<p>DARTH SIDIOUS: I will make it legal?</p>
<p>NUTE: And the... Jedi?</p>
<p>DARTH SIDIOUS: The Chancellor should have never brought them into
this. Kill them, immediately.</p>
<p>NUTE: Yes... yes, My Lord. As you wish.</p>
<p>INT REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT - DOCKING BAY</p>
<p>In the cockpit of the cruiser, the CAPTAIN and PILOT look up to see a gun
turret swing around and point directly at them.</p>
<p>PILOT: Captain?! Look!!</p>
<p>The CAPTAIN looks up and just seconds before they are fired upon says
something inaudible.</p>
<p>EXT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HANGAR BAY - SPACE (FX)</p>
<p>The battleship gun fires and the republic cruiser EXPLODES.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM</p>
<p>QUI-GON and OBI-WAN leap to a standing position with their laser swords
drawn. TC-14 jumps back, started, spilling the drinks on the tray.</p>
<p>TC-14: ... Sorry.</p>
<p>QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn off their laser swords and listen intently. A faint
hissing sound can be heard.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Dioxin!</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY</p>
<p>A hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference
room hallway.</p>
<p>NUTE: They must be dead by now. Destroy, what's left of them.</p>
<p>The hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the door.
A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their weapons as
a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the tray of drinks.</p>
<p>TC-14: Oh, excuse me.</p>
<p>The PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp.</p>
<p>OWO-1: Check it out Corporal. We'll cover you.</p>
<p>BATTLE DROID: Roger, roger.</p>
<p>Two flashing laser swords suddenly fly out of the deadly fog.</p>
<p>OWO-1: Uh-oh, blast them...</p>
<p>The two Jedi start cutting down BATTLE DROIDS as the droids fire on them.
OBI-WAN jumps in the air and does a mid-air flip as he deflects laser bolts.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</p>
<p>NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-1 on the viewscreen.</p>
<p>OWO-1 is suddenly cut in half. RUNE gives NUTE a worried look.</p>
<p>NUTE: What is going on down there?</p>
<p>The bridge is a cacophony of alarms.</p>
<p>TEY HOW: We've lost the transmission, sir.</p>
<p>RUNE: Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?</p>
<p>NUTE: Well, no, but I don't... (panicked) Seal off the bridge.</p>
<p>TEY HOW: Yes sir.</p>
<p>RUNE: That won't be enough, sir.</p>
<p>NUTE: I want droidekas up here at once!!!</p>
<p>RUNE: We will not survive this.</p>
<p>The doors to the bridge SLAM shut.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE</p>
<p>QUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower of sparks and
metal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending several BATTLE DROIDS crashing
into the wall.</p>
<p>QUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</p>
<p>The CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.</p>
<p>NUTE: Close the blast doors!!!</p>
<p>The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then a
third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut.</p>
<p>NUTE: That will hold them.</p>
<p>QUI-GON s tabs the door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot
appears in the center of the blast door. OBI-WAN cuts down another BATTLE DROID
in defense of his Master.</p>
<p>RUNE: ... They're still coming through!</p>
<p>On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.</p>
<p>NUTE: This is impossible!!</p>
<p>RUNE: Where are those droidekas?!</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE</p>
<p>Two ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just
before they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their battle
configuration.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Master, destroyers.</p>
<p>QUI-GON stops penetrating the blast doors and turns to fight off the
destroyer droids with OBI-WAN. The droids start to shoot their laser guns at the
Jedi and an invisible shield appears around them.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: They have shield generators.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: It's a standoff! Let's go!</p>
<p>QUI-GON and OBI-Wan leave the hallway just outside the bridge as the two
destroyer droids turn around and continue shooting. The Jedi materialize at the
far end of the hallway and dash through the doorway that slams shut. The WHEEL
DROIDS blast away at the two JEDI with their laser swords.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</p>
<p>NUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL
DROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway.</p>
<p>RUNE: ... They're no match for droidekas.</p>
<p>TEY HOW: Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY</p>
<p>QUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay. They are
careful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing
craft.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Battle droids.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: It's an invisible army.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: This is an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to
warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard
separate ships and meet down on the planet.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were
short.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</p>
<p>TEY HOW receives a transmission.</p>
<p>TEY HOW: Sir, a transmission from the planet.</p>
<p>RUNE: It's Queen Amidala herself.</p>
<p>NUTE: At last we're getting results.</p>
<p>On the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room. Wearing her
elaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the GOVERNING COUNCIL and
FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.</p>
<p>NUTE: (cont'd) Again you come before me, Your highness.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say,
Viceroy ... Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.</p>
<p>NUTE smirks at RUNE.</p>
<p>NUTE: I was not aware of such a failure.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: I'm aware the Chancellor's Ambassadors are with you now, and
that you have been commanded to reach a settlement.</p>
<p>NUTE: I know nothing of any Ambassadors ... you must be mistaken.</p>
<p>AMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: Beware, Viceroy....the Federation has gone too far this time.</p>
<p>NUTE: We would never do anything without the approval of the Senate.
You assume too much.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: We will see.</p>
<p>The QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.</p>
<p>RUNE: She's right, the Senate will never....</p>
<p>NUTE: It's too late now.</p>
<p>RUNE: Do you think she suspects an attack?</p>
<p>NUTE: I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all
communications down there.</p>
<p>INT NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM</p>
<p>The QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand before a
hologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: ...The negotiations haven't started because the Ambassadors
aren't there? How could that be true? I have assurances from the Chancellor...
his Ambassadors did arrive. It must be the... get... negotiate...</p>
<p>The hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: Senator Palpatine?!? (turns to Panaka) What's happening?</p>
<p>CAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SARGEANT</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: Check the transmission generators...</p>
<p>BIBBLE: A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: The Federation would not dare go that far.</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and
they'd be finished.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: We must continue to rely on negotiation.</p>
<p>BIBBLE: Negotiation? We've lost all communications! ... and where are
the Chancellors Ambassadors?</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our
security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to
war.</p>
<p>EXT SPACE LANDING CRAFT - TWILIGHT (FX)</p>
<p>Six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo.</p>
<p>EXT NABOO SWAMP - SHALLOW LAKE - TWILIGHT</p>
<p>Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the perpetually
gray twilight side of the planet. One by one, the Federation warships land in
the eerie swamp.</p>
<p>TROOP TRANSPORTS (MTT's) emerge from the landing craft as a HALF DOZEN BATTLE
DROIDS on STAPS fly by.</p>
<p>EXT NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP / GRASS PLAINS - TWILIGHT (FX)</p>
<p>The droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain.
OOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching across the rolling
hills. A small hologram of RUNE and NUTE stands on the tank.</p>
<p>OOM-9: Yes, Viceroy?</p>
<p>RUNE: Captain, we've searched the ship and there is no trace of the
Jedi. They may have got on onto one of your landing craft.</p>
<p>OOM-9: If they are down here, sir, we'll find them.</p>
<p>NUTE: Use caution. These Jedi are not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>EXT NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT</p>
<p>QUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the
monstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist.</p>
<p>Animals begin to run past him in a panic.</p>
<p>An odd, frog-like GUNGAN, JAR JAR B INKS, squats holding a clam he has
retrieved from the murky swamp. JAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other
creatures running like the wind toward him. One of the huge MTT's bears down on
the JEDI like a charging locomotive. JAR JAR stands transfixed, still holding
the clam shell in one hand.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Oh, noooooooooo!</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Quick! Get out of here!</p>
<p>JAR JAR drops the shell and leaps onto QUI-GON as he mumbles something
inaudible. The JEDI is caught by surprise.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Get off!</p>
<p>JAR JAR continues to mumble something. The machine is about to crush them as
QUI-GON drops to the ground. JAR JAR goes splat into the mud with him. The
transport races overhead.</p>
<p>QUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They stand watching the
war machine disappear into the mist.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Whas dat?</p>
<p>QUI-GON starts to walk away to find OBI-WAN. JAR JAR runs after him.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Hey wait!</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!</p>
<p>QUI-GON: You almost got us killed! Are you brainless?</p>
<p>JAR JAR: I spake.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get
outta here!</p>
<p>QUI-GON starts to move off, and JAR JAR follows.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: No... no! Mesa stay...Mesa culled Ja Ja Binksss. Mesa yous
humble servaunt.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: That won't be necessary.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Oh boot tit tis! Tis demunded byda guds it tis.</p>
<p>In the distance, two STAPS burst out of the mist at high speed, chasing
OBI-WAN.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: (cont'd) Oh, nooooo!</p>
<p>QUI-GON throws JAR JAR into the mud.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Stay down!</p>
<p>The two troops fire laser bolts at OBI-WAN. QUI-GON deflects the bolts back,
and the STAPS blow up. One-two. OBI-WAN is exhausted and tries to catch his
breath. Suddenly, JAR JAR pops up.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Yousa sav-ed my again!</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: What's this?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: A local. Let's go, before more of those droids show up.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Mure? Mure did you spake??!?</p>
<p>OBI-WAN and QUI-GON start to run. JAR JAR tries to keep up.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: (cont'd) Ex-squeeze me, but de mosta safest place would be
GungaCity. Tis where I grew up ... Tis a hidden city.</p>
<p>They all stop.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: A city!</p>
<p>JAR JAR nods his head.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Uhhu.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: (cont'd) Can you take us there?</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Ahhh, ... on second taut ... no, not willy, no.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: No??!</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Iss embarrissing, boot ahh... My afrai my've bean banished.
My forgoten der Bosses would do terrible tings to my. Terrible tings if my goen
back dare.</p>
<p>A PULSATING SOUND is heard in the distance.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: You hear that?</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Yeah.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: (cont'd) That's the sound of a thousand terrible things
heading this way...</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: If they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little
pieces, then blast us into oblivion!</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Oh! Yousa point is well said. Dis way! Hurry!</p>
<p>JAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp.</p>
<p>EXT NABOO SWAMP LAKE - TWILIGHT</p>
<p>QUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop as JAR JAR tries
to catch his breath. The TRANSPORTS ARE HEARD in the distance.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: How much farther?</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?</p>
<p>QUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility belts that turn
into breathing masks.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: (cont'd) ... and my warning yous. Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't expicin wern welcome.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Don't worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes.</p>
<p>JAR JAR jumps, yells out, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives
into the water.</p>
<p>Breath masks on, QUI-GON and OBI-WAN wade in after him. Before they continue,
JAR JAR surfaces.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Ahh... yousa follow me now, okeyday?</p>
<p>EXT NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER</p>
<p>QUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at home in the
water. Down they swim into murky depths. In the distance the glow of Otoh Gunga,
an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct.</p>
<p>They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. JAR JAR swims magically
through one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind him. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON
follow.</p>
<p>INT OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE</p>
<p>GUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Sooo good beein home.</p>
<p>Two GUNGANS start talking gibberish. JAR JAR and the JEDI walk a little
further as a GUNGAN, CAPTAIN TARPALS, armed with a long electro-pole rides up on
a two-legged KAADU into the square.</p>
<p>CAPT. TARPALS: Hey yousa, stopa there.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Heyo-dalee, Cap'n Tarpals, Mesa back!</p>
<p>CAPT. TARPALS: Noah gain, Ja Ja. Yousa goen tada Bosses. Yousa in big
dudu this time.</p>
<p>JAR JAR hangs his head and wines. Another GUARD comes up on KAADU armed with
an electro-pole and gives JAR JAR a slight zap with his power pole. JAR JAR
jumps and moves off, followed by the two JEDI.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: How wude.</p>
<p>INT OTOH GUNGA - HIGH TOWER BOARD ROOM</p>
<p>The Bosses' Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted fish swimming
around outside like moving stars. A long circular judge's bench filled with
GUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates the room. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand facing BOSS NASS,
who sits on a bench higher than the others.</p>
<p>BOSS NASS: Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of mackineeks up dare tis
new weesong!</p>
<p>QUI-GON: That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn
them.</p>
<p>BOSS NASS: Wesa no like da Naboo! Da Naboo tink day so smarty. Day
tink day brains so big.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Once those droids take control of the surface, they will take
control of you.</p>
<p>BOSS NASS: Mesa no tink so. Dey not know of uss-en.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle. What happens to one
of you will affect the other. You must understand this.</p>
<p>BOSS NASS: Wesa no care-n about da Naboo.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: (waves his hand) Then speed us on our way.</p>
<p>BOSS NASS: Wesa gonna speed yousaway.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: We could use a transport.</p>
<p>BOSS NASS: Wesa give yousa una bongo. Da speedest way tooda Naboo tis

<p>QUI-GON: Thank you for your help. We leave in peace.</p>
<p>QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn to leave.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Master, what's a bongo?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: A transport, I hope.</p>
<p>The JEDI notice JAR JAR in chains to one side, waiting to hear his verdict.
QUI-GON stops. JAR JAR gives him a forlorn look.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Daza setten yousa up. Goen through da planet core is bad
bombin!! Ahhh... any hep hair would be hot.</p>
<p>JAR JAR's soulful look is counter-pointed by a sheepish grin.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Master, we're short of time.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: We'll need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. This
Gungan my be of help.</p>
<p>QUI-GON walks back to BOSS NASS.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: (cont'd) What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?</p>
<p>BOSS NASS: Hisen to be pune-ished.</p>
<p>JAR JAR hangs his head and wines.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I have saved his life. He owes me what you call a
"life.debt." QUI-GON waves his hand.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now.</p>
<p>BOSS NASS: Binks. Yousa haveda liveplay with thisen hisen?</p>

<p>EXT NABOO CITY - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)</p>
<p>A strange little submarine propels itself away from the Otoh Gunga, leaving
the glow of the settlement in the distance.</p>
<p>INT SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER</p>
<p>OBI-WAN in the co-pilots seat, JAR JAR guides the craft.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Dis is nutsen... Ooo, gooberfish!</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Why were you banished, Jar Jar?</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Tis a longo taleo, buta small part of it wawdbe mesa... aaaa.....
clumsy.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: You were banished because you were clumsy?</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Ahh... Yousa mighten be sayin dat.</p>
<p>JAR JAR veers the craft to the left and turns the lights on. The coral vistas
are grand, fantastic, and wondrous.</p>
<p>As the little sub glides into the planet core, a large dark shape begins to
follow.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Mesa cause-ed mabee one or duey lettal bitty axadentes...yud-say
boom da gasser, un crash Der Bosses heyblibber...den banished.</p>
<p>Suddenly there is a loud CRASH, and the little craft lurches to one side.
QUI-GON looks around and sees a huge, luminous</p>
<p>OPEE SEA KILLER has hooked them with its long gooey tongue.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Uh-oh. Big gooberfish. Huge Opee.</p>
<p>Suddenly an even larger monster has attacked the OPEE SEA KILLER.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: There's always a bigger fish.</p>
<p>As the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws, munching on the hapless
KILLER. The jaws belong to the incredible SANDO AQUA MONSTER. The lights on the
tiny sub begin to flicker as they cruise deeper into the gloom.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</p>
<p>NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.</p>
<p>NUTE: The invasion is on schedule, My Lord.</p>
<p>DARTH SIDIOUS: I have the Senate bogged down in procedures. They will have no
choice but to accept your control of the system.</p>
<p>NUTE: The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her.</p>
<p>DARTH SIDIOUS: Queen Amidala is young and naive. You will find controlling
her will not be difficult.</p>
<p>NUTE: Yes, My Lord.</p>
<p>DARTH SIDIOUS fades away.</p>
<p>RUNE: You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi?</p>
<p>NUTE: No need to report that to him, until we have something to report.</p>
<p>INT SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER</p>

<p>QUI-GON: Don't worry, the Force will guide us...</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Ooooh, maxibig..."da Force"...Well, dat smells stinkowiff.</p>
<p>An alarm sounds on the control panel.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: ... we're losing power.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Oh, no...</p>
<p>OBI-WAN lands the sub in a cave and the lights go out.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Oh, wesa diein here.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak'n in here, all'n sink'n, and
nooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINKEN WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!?</p>
<p>The wires start to spark.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Power's back.</p>
<p>The lights flicker on, revealing an ugly COLO CLAW FISH right in front of
them.</p>
<p>The large COLO CLAW FISH is surprised and rears back. The sub turns around
and speeds away.</p>
<p>JAR JAR continues to panic and babble incoherently.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Relax.</p>
<p>QUI-GON puts his hand on JAR JAR's shoulder. JAR JAR relaxes into a coma.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: You overdid it.</p>
<p>The COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub. The sub narrowly avoids the
deadly teeth of the AQUA MONSTER. The COLO CLAW FISH chasing them isn't so
lucky. It is munched in half by the larger predator.</p>
<p>JAR JAR regains consciousness.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Head for that outcropping.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Oie Boie!</p>
<p>The little sub speeds away.</p>

<p>EXT THEED PLAZA - DAY (FX)</p>
<p>As the QUEEN watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport
carrying NUTE and RUNE lands in Theed Plaza. They exit the transport.</p>

<p>Paradise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a LOUD
RUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Oo. Dis seem uverly.</p>
<p>QUI-GON stands and looks around to see if the coast is clear.</p>
<p>INT THEED - PALACE - DAY</p>
<p>QUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS (EIRTAE, YANE, PADME,
RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by a half dozen DROIDS. CAPTAIN PANAKA and FOUR
NABOO GUARDS are also with them as they are lead down stairs to the main floor.
NUTE and RUNE are walking with the group.</p>
<p>BIBBLE: ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?</p>
<p>NUTE: The Queen and I will sign a treaty that will legitimize our occupation
here. I assurances it will be ratified by the Senate.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: I will not co-operate.</p>
<p>NUTE: Now, now, your Highness. In time, the suffering of your people will
persuade you to see our point of view. Commander?</p>
<p>OOM-9 steps forward.</p>
<p>OOM-9: Yes, sir!</p>
<p>NUTE: Process them.</p>
<p>OOM-9 turns to his sergeant.</p>
<p>OOM-9: Captain, take them to Camp Four.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: Roger, roger.</p>
<p>The SERGEANT marches the GROUP down the rest of the stairs and into the
plaza.</p>
<p>EXT PALACE - PLAZA - DAY</p>
<p>QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTA, YANE, RABE, SACHE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, SIO BIBBLE,
and FOUR GUARDS are led out of the palace by ten BATTLE DROIDS. The plaza is
filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS, which they pass on their way to the
detention camp. Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak across
on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an attack to
rescue the QUEEN.</p>
<p>FOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS move forward and are
also cut down by the JEDIS' flashing lightsabres until there is only the DROID
SERGEANT left. The SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to QUI-GON by the
Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: We should leave the streets, your highness.</p>
<p>SIO BIBBLE takes QUEEN AMIDALA away.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN PANAKA turns to the GUARDS.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN PANAKA: Get their weapons.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Woah. Yousa guys bombad!</p>
<p>QUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting used to this.
They move between two buildings.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: We're the Ambassadors, for the Supreme Chancellor.</p>
<p>BIBBLE: Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: The negotiations never took place. It's urgent that we make contact
with the republic.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN PANAKA steps forward.</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: They've knocked out all our communications.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Do you have transports?</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: In the main hanger. This way.</p>
<p>THEY disappear down an alleyway as the ALARMS are sounded</p>
<p>INT CENTRAL HANGER - HALLWAY - DAY</p>
<p>CAPTAIN PANAKA cracks open a side door to the central hanger. QUI-GON looks
in over his shoulder. OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, and the rest of the group are behind
him. They see several Naboo spacecraft guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE DROIDS.
ALARMS can be heard in the distance.</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: There are too many of them.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: That won't be a problem. (to Amidala) Your Highness, under the
circumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: They will kill you if you stay.</p>
<p>BIBBLE: They wouldn't dare.</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of theirs
legal. They can't afford to kill her.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: There is something else behind all this, Your Highness. There is no
logic in the Federation's move here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.</p>
<p>BIBBLE: Our only hope is for the Senate to side with us ... Senator Palpatine
will need your help.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: Either choice presents great danger.</p>
<p>The QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: (cont'd) ... to us all.</p>
<p>PADME: We are brave, Your Highness.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: Then, I will plead our case to the Senate. (to Bibble as they are
start to leave) Be careful, Governor.</p>
<p>INT CENTRAL HANGER - DAY</p>
<p>The door opens to the main hanger. QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, CAPTAIN PANAKA,
TWO GUARDS, and THREE HANDMAIDENS (PADME, EIRTAE, RABE), followed by QUEEN
AMIDALA, head for a sleek chrome spacecraft. SIO BIBBLE, YANE and SACHE stay
behind. The HANDMAIDENS begin to cry.</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: We need to free those pilots.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN PANAKA points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, and PILOTS held in a
corner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: I'll deal with that.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN heads toward the group of captured pilots.</p>
<p>QUI-GON and the QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and the rest Of the GROUP
approach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo craft.</p>
<p>GUARD DROID: Halt?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking these
people to Coruscant.</p>
<p>GUARD DROID: Where are you taking them?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: To Coruscant.</p>
<p>GUARD DROID: Coruscant!? Ahh, that doesn't compute. ... Ahh, wait! ... Ahh,
you're under arrest!</p>
<p>The DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the DROIDS can fire, they
are cut down. OTHER GUARDS run to their aid.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN attacks the GUARDS around the PILOTS.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Go!</p>
<p>QUI-GON stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS rush on board the
spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC OLIE), GUARDS and GROUND
CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship. The OTHER PILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO
BIBBLE. After everyone has made it onto the ship, QUI-GON jumps on board.</p>

<p>OBI-WAN: Now stay here, and keep out of trouble.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN closes the door. JAR JAR looks around and sees a long row of five
short, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units). The all look alike, except for
thier paint color, and they all seem to be shut down.</p>

<p>A blue alarm light flashes as all the DROIDS are activated. The DROIDS rush

<p>One LITTLE BLUE ASTRO DROID, who is especially dedicated, lets out a loud
screech as he runs into JAR JAR.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: How wude!</p>
<p>The BLUE ASTRO DROID continues to beep in exclamation as he too rushes toward
the air lock.</p>
<p>The LITTLE DROID enters the air lock and is ejected onto the exterior of the

<p>EXT NABOO SPACECRAFT - SPACE (FX)</p>
<p>The lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship. The

<p>RIC OLIE: There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant... the hyperdrive
is leaking.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.</p>
<p>QUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The
Trade Federation has no presence there.</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: How can you be sure?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: It's controlled by the Hutts...</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are
gangsters ... If they discovered her ...</p>
<p>QUI-GON: ... It would be no different than if we landed on a system
controlled by the Federation ... except the Hutts aren't looking for her, which
gives us an advantage.</p>

doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: It is to be commended...what is its number?</p>
<p>The LITTLE BLUE DROID lets out a series of bleeps. CAPTAIN PANAKA leans over
and scrapes some dirt off of the side of the DROID and read the number:</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: R2-D2, Your Highness.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: Thank you, Artoo Detoo... Padme!</p>
<p>PADME bows before the QUEEN.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: (Cont'd) Clean this droid up the best you can. It deserves our
gratitude... (to Panaka) Continue, Captain.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN PANAKA looks nervously to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Your Highness, with your permission we're heading for a remote
planet called Tatooine. It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade
Federation.</p>

<p>CAPT. PANAKA: (Cont'd) Wait. Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden
with you.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport is

stacked up behind it.</p>
<p>INT WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY</p>
<p>QUI-GON, JAR JAR, PADME, and ARTOO enter the dingy junk shop and are greeted
by WATTO, a pudgy blue alien who flies on short little wings like a hummingbird.</p>
<p>WATTO: (subtitled) Guta naloya. (Good day to you.)</p>
<p>WATTO flies over to the visitors.</p>
<p>WATTO: (cont'd)(subtitled) Ha chuba da nala? (What do you want?)</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.</p>
<p>WATTO: Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. (subtitled) Peedenk!
Naba dee unko (Boy, get in here! Now!)</p>
<p>QUI-GON: My droid here has a readout of what I need.</p>
<p>A disheveled boy, ANAKIN SKYWALKER, runs in from the junk yard. He is about
nine years old, very dirty, and dressed in rags.</p>
<p>WATTO turns to ANAKIN.</p>
<p>WATTO: (subtitled) Coona tee-tocky malia? (What took you so long?)</p>
<p>ANAKIN: (subtitled) Mel tassa cho-passa... (I was cleaning the bin like
you...)</p>
<p>WATTO: (subtitled) Chut-Chut! Ganda doe wallya. Me dwana no bata. (Watch the
store. I've got some selling to do here.) (to Gui-Gon) Soooo, let me take - a
thee out back. Ni you'll find what you need.</p>
<p>ARTOO and QUI-GON follow WATTO toward the junk yard, leaving JAR JAR with
PADME and the young boy ANAKIN. JAR JAR picks up a gizmo, trying to figure out
its purpose. QUI-GON takes the part out of his hand and puts it back.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Don't touch anything.</p>
<p>JAR JAR makes a rude face to QUI-GON's back and sticks out his long tongue.
ANAKIN sits on the counter, pretending to clean a part, staring at PADME. She is
the most beautiful creature he has ever seen in his life. PADME is a little
embarrassed by his stare, but she musters up an amused smile. Finally, he gets
the courage to speak.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Are you an angel?</p>
<p>PADME: What?</p>
<p>ANAKIN: An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They are
the most beautiful creatures in the universe. They live on the Moons of Iego I
think.</p>
<p>PADME looks at him, not knowing what to say.</p>
<p>PADME: You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I listen to all the traders and starpilots that come by here. I'm a
pilot, you know, and some day I'm gonna fly away from this place.</p>
<p>PADME: You're a pilot?</p>
<p>ANAKIN: All my life.</p>
<p>PADME: How long have you been here?</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to
Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces.</p>
<p>PADME: You're ... a slave?</p>
<p>ANAKIN looks at PADME defiantly.</p>
ANAKIN:I am a person! My name is Anakin.</p>
<p>PADME: I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. (looking around) This is a
strange place to me.</p>
<p>ANAKIN studies her intently.</p>
<p>JAR JAR pushes the nose on what appears to be a LITTLE DROID, and it
instantly comes to life, grows legs and arms, and starts marching around,
knocking over everything. JAR JAR hold on but can't stop it.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Hey...</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Wha?</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Hit the nose!</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Oh!</p>
<p>JAR JAR hits the nose, and the DROID collapses back into its original state.

hereabouts who has one... but thee might as well buy a new ship. It would be
cheaper, I think... Saying of which, how's thee going to pay for all this?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I have 20,000 Republic dataries.</p>

something more real...</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I don't have anything else. (raising his hand) But credits will do
fine.</p>
<p>WATTO: No they won'ta.</p>
<p>QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand again.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Credits will do fine.</p>
<p>WATTO:  No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your
hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only
money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I
promise you that.</p>

<p>ANAKIN: ... wouldn't have lasted long if I weren't so good at fixing things.</p>
<p>JAR JAR pulls a part out of a stack of parts to inspect it, and they all come
tumbling down. He struggles to catch them, only to knock more down. ANAKIN and
PADME are oblivious.</p>
<p>QUI-GON hurries into the shop, followed by ARTOO.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: We're leaving. Jar Jar?</p>
<p>The stuff JAR JAR is juggling crashes to the ground. PADME gives ANAKIN a
loving look.</p>
<p>PADME: I'm glad to have met you.</p>
<p>PADME turns, and ANAKIN looks sad as he watches her leave.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I was glad to meet you too.</p>

<p>OBI-WAN: (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe. But
not enough for you to barter with. Not in the amounts you're talking about.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: All right. I'm sure another solution will present itself. I'll check
back later.</p>

grabs his arm.</p>

walking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough gang
of aliens, one of which is especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like creature. JAR
JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs hanging on a wire.
He looks around to see if anyone is looking, then sticks out his tongue, and
gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth. Unfortunately, the frog is tied
tightly to the wire. The vendor suddenly appears.</p>
<p>VENDOR: (subtitled) Ay, ay. Yawoba wonga? (Are you going to pay for that?)</p>
<p>JAR JAR turns his head in surprise.</p>
<p>VENDOR: Uga wupiupi wep. (It costs seven wupiupi.</p>
<p>JAR JAR opens his mouth and the frog snaps away., ricochets around the
market, and lands in Sebulba's soup, splashing him. As JAR JAR moves away from
the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the hapless Gungan.</p>
<p>SEBULBA: Chuba!!</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Ooops.</p>
<p>JAR JAR starts to whistle as he walks away.</p>
<p>Angry, SEBULBA gets up an hops over to JAR JAR and kicks him.</p>
<p>SEBULBA: (subtitled) Ni chuba ni?? (Is this yours??)</p>
<p>SEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Who, mesa?</p>
<p>SEBULBA grabs JAR JAR by the neck. QUI-GON looks around for JAR JAR and sees
him in a fight.</p>
<p>JAR JAR turns to see ANAKNI pushing his way next to him. The boy stands up to
SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: (subtitled) Chesko Sebulba... Cha pooka uman geesa... Matesa ratico
ponipa chop chowa. (Careful, Sebulba... He's a big time outlander... I'd hate to
see you diced before we race again.)</p>
<p>SEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN.</p>
<p>SEBULBA: (subtitled) Nic me chouwa wimo noke maka noke. (Next time we race,
boy, it will be the end of you!) Una noto wo shag, me wompity du pom pom. (If
you weren't a slave, I'd squash you now.)</p>

<p>ANAKIN: (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it'd be a pity if you
had to pay for me.)</p>
<p>QUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: (Cont'd) Hi!</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Hi there.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange goo. He picked a
fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Mesa haten crunchen. Dat's da last ting mesa wanten.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Nevertheless, the boy is right ... you were heading for trouble...
Thanks, my young friend.</p>
<p>PADME looks at ANAKIN and smiles; he smiles back. They start walking down the
crowded street.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: But... but... mesa doen nutteen!</p>

<p>ANAKIN: Here, you'll like these pallies... Here.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Thank you.</p>
<p>QUI-GON takes them puting them in a little pouch under his poncho, revealing
for a moment, his lightsaber.</p>
<p>JIRA: Oh, my bones are aching ... storm's coming up, Annie. You'd better get
home quick.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: (to QUI-GON) Do you have shelter?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: We'll head back to our ship.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Is it far?</p>
<p>PADME: It's on the outskirts.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: You'll never reach the outskirts in time... sandstorms are very, very
dangerous. Come on! I'll take you to my place.</p>

her work area and is startled to see the room full of people.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: These are my friends, Mom.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Hidoe!</p>
<p>ARTOO lets out a little beep.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I'm building a droid. You wanna see?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Come on! I'll show you Threepio!</p>

<p>INT ANAKIN'S HOVEL - BEDROOM - DAY</p>
<p>ARTOO rolls through the doorway as ANAKIN shows off his DROID, which is lying
on his workbench. There is one eye in the head; the body, arms, and legs have no
outer coverings.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet.</p>
<p>PADME: He's wonderful!</p>
<p>ARTOO continues to lets out a few warbles.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: You really like him? He's a protocol droid ... to help Mom. Watch!</p>
<p>ANAKIN pushes a button, and the DROID sits up.</p>
<p>THREEPIO: Oh, oh. Where is everybody?</p>
<p>Anakin reaches over and grabs an eye and puts it in one of the sockets.</p>
<p>THREEPIO: Oh, hello, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How might I
serve you?</p>
<p>PADME: He's perfect.</p>
<p>THREEPIO: Oh, perfect.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: When the storm is over, I'll show you my racer.</p>
<p>THREEPIO starts to walk away as ANAKIN contines talking to PADME.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: (cont'd) I'm building a Podracer!</p>
<p>PADME smiles at his enthusiasm. THREEPIO: I'm not sure this floor is entirely
stable. Oh, hello. I don't believe we've been introduced.</p>
<p>ARTOO lets out a flurry of beeps and whistles.</p>
<p>THREEPIO: Artoo-Detoo. A pleasure to meet you. I am See-Threepio, Human

find them quickly, Master.</p>
<p>DARTH SIDIOUS: Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no difficulty
in taking the Queen to Naboo to sign the treaty.</p>
<p>DARTH MAUL: At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will

where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin's house.</p>
<p>INT ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY</p>
<p>QUI-GON, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a table. JAR JAR slurps
his soup as SHMI walks over pours him a drink. JAR JAR looks up at her as she
moves on. ARTOO beeps as he looks on from the corner of the room.</p>
<p>SHMI: All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I've been working on a scanner to try and locate mine.</p>
<p>SHMI:  Any attempt to escape...</p>
<p>ANAKIN:  ... and they blow you up ... boom!</p>
<p>JAR JAR: How wude.</p>
<p>PADME: I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The Republic's
anti-slavery laws...</p>
<p>SHMI: The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.</p>
<p>JAR JAR snatches some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his
tongue. PADME looks over at JAR JAR. QUI-GON gives him a dirty look.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: 'Scuse me.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?</p>
<p>PADME shakes her head no.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I'm the only human who can do it.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.</p>
<p>ANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl
with his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and
forefinger. JAR JAR is startled.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: (Cont'd) Don't do that again.</p>
<p>JAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of the
tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: You're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: What makes you think that?</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.</p>
<p>QUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I don't think so ... No one can kill a Jedi.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I wish that were so...</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here to free all the
slaves... have you come to free us?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: No, I'm afraid not ...</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I think you have ... why else would you be here?</p>
<p>QUI-GON thinks for a moment.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I can see there's no fooling you ... (leans forward) We're on our
way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic, on a very important
mission.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: How did you end up here in the outer rim?</p>
<p>PADME:  Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I can help! I can fix anything!</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I believe you can, but first we must acquire the parts we need...</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Wit no-nutten mula to trade.</p>
<p>PADME: These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.</p>
<p>SHMI: Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Podracing ... Greed can be a powerful ally.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race
tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod.</p>
<p>SHMI: Anakin! Watto won't let you...</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him
think it's yours, and get him to let me pilot it for you.</p>
<p>QUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.</p>
<p>SHMI: I don't want you to race. It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you
do it.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: But Mom, I love it. The prize money would more than pay for the parts
they need.</p>
<p>SHMI: Anakin!</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who
might help us?</p>
<p>SHMI shakes her head no.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Mom... you said the biggest problem in the universe is nobody helps
each other...</p>
<p>SHMI sighs heavily.</p>
<p>PADME: I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We'll find
some other way...</p>

<p>PADME: Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know.
The Queen will not approve.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: The Queen does not need to know.</p>

Not on Republic credits, I think, huh. (he laughs)</p>
<p>QUI-GON: My ship will be the entry fee.</p>
<p>QUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and a
hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of WATTO. He
studies it.</p>
<p>WATTO:  Oh, not bad... not bad... ah Nubian, ah.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: It's in good order, except for the parts I need.</p>
<p>WATTO: ... what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last race. It
will take some time to fix it.</p>
<p>ANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Ahhhh ... it wasn't my fault really... Sebulba flashed me with his
vents. I actually saved the Pod... mostly.</p>
<p>WATTO: (laughing) That you did huh. The boy is good, no doubts there huh.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Well, I have acquired a Pod in a game of chance. "The fastest
ever built."</p>
<p>WATTO: I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you supply
the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings fifty-fifty,
I think.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the cash for
the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I
need... If we lose, you keep my ship.</p>
<p>WATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: (Cont'd) Either way, you win.</p>
<p>WATTO: Deal!</p>

<p>QUI-GON: He has special powers.</p>
<p>SHMI: Yes...</p>
<p>QUI-GON: He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have
such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.</p>
<p>SHMI: He deserves better than a slave's life.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him
early. The Force is unusually strong with him, that much is clear. Who is his
father?</p>
<p>SHMI: There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him, I can't
explain what happened.</p>

with one of the energy binder plates.</p>

gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.</p>
<p>JAR JAR drops the tool he had, bends down to pick it up and come right up
into the energy binders. It makes a little electronic pop, zaps him in the mouth
and he jumps back. JAR JAR tries to say something, but his mouth is numb and his
words are garbled.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Ouch muy tonge is fat. Muy togne. Oucho. (Gibberish)</p>

vehicles. WATTO, QUI-GON, and JAR JAR walk through the activity.</p>
<p>WATTO: ... I wanta see your spaceship the moment the race is over.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Patience, my good friend. You'll have your winnings before the suns
set, and we'll be far away from here.</p>
<p>WATTO: Not if your ship belongs to me, I think... I warn you, no funny
business.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: You don't think Anakin will win?</p>
<p>WATTO stops before an orange racer. Sitting to one side, having his shoulders
and neck massaged by TWIN YOBANAS, is SEBULBA.</p>
<p>WATTO: Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit to
your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.</p>
<p>WATTO flies over to where SEBULBA is getting a massage as JAR JAR's eyes bug
out in shock.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Oh-no!</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Why do you think that?</p>
<p>WATTO: He always wins. (laughs) I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I'll take that bet.</p>

<p>QUI-GON: I'll wager my new racing pod against... say... the boy and his
mother.</p>
<p>WATTO: No Pod's worth two slaves ... not by a long shot.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: The boy, then ...</p>
<p>WATTO thinks a bit as JAR JAR looks around.</p>
<p>WATTO: We'll let fate decide, huh. I just happen to have a chance cube here.
Blue it's the boy, red his mother...</p>
<p>WATTO tosses the cube down. QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly; it turns blue.

<p>Behind JAR JAR, SEBULBA comes up to ANAKINS pod engines and disconnects
something, laughing. He continues to walk toward the cockpit where ANAKIN
contines to connect things.</p>
<p>SEBULBA: Bazda wahota, shag. Dobiella Nok. (You won't walk away from this
one, Skywalker. You slave scum.)</p>
<p>ANAKIN: (subtitled) Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo. (Don't count on it,

<p>SEBULBA walks away as QUI-GON walks up.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: You all set, Ani?</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Yep.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: All right.</p>
<p>QUI-GON picks him up and sets him down in the racer.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Remember, concentrate on the moment. Feel. Don't think. Use your

<p>On a bridge over the track, a great green light at the center flashes. The
Podracers shoot forward with a high-pitches scream.</p>
<p>ANAKIN'S engine floods and coughs - then dies. All the other Podracers except
one swerve around him and dissapear down the track. The slave boy struggles to
get his racer started. The two-headed announcer reports.</p>
<p>FODE/BEED: (O.S.)</p>
<p>FODE: An dare ovv!</p>
<p>BEED: Oh...wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.</p>

<p>QUADRINAROS works franticaly on his pod.</p>
<p>FODE/BEED: (O.S.)</p>
<p>BEED: Well it looks like Quadrinaros is having engine trouble also.</p>
<p>QUADRINAROS pounds on his dashboard in frustration.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: C'mon Ani!</p>
<p>Finally, Anakin's engines ignite. He zooms away after the receeding pack of
competitors, leaving one quadra-Pod racer still trying to get started. The
two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the race as it progresses.</p>
<p>FODE/BEED: (O.S.)</p>
<p>BEED: And there goes Skywalker...</p>

<p>BEED: (cont'd) He'll be hard pressed to catch up with the leaders.</p>
<p>EXT MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)</p>
<p>The Podracers fly across the desert. SEBULBA is running neck and neck with
MAWHONIC. They round the first turn in the track, side by side. SEBULBA drives
his Pod into his rival, forcing him into the wall of a large rock formation.
MAWHONIC crashes in a spectacular display of fire and smoke.</p>
<p>ANAKIN is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them easily.</p>
<p>One of the drivers, GASGANO, won't let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN tries to pass him on
one side and is cut off. He then tries to pass him on the other side ansd is cut
off. As they come up on a cliff drop-off, ANAKIN backs off, then guns it as
GASGANO goes over the cliff. ANAJIN accelerates so fast that he sails right over
the top of GASGANO and speeds away.</p>
<p>Four TUSKEN RAIDERS perched above the race course fire their rifles at the
Pods racing in the canyon below them. One shot ricochets off the back of
Anakin's Pod.</p>
<p>FODE/BEED:</p>
<p>BEED: Looks like a few Tusken Riaders have camped out on the canyon dune turn.</p>
<p>EXT MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY</p>
<p>The quadra-Pod engines start just as the racers come around the corner. The
DRIVER, BEN QUADRINAROS, puts it in gear, and the four engines go off in all

<p>FODE/BEED:</p>
<p>BEED: Ooo! There goes Quadrinaros power cuppling.</p>
<p>The Pod drops to the ground as SEBULBA enters the arena, closely followed by
all the OTHER RACERS.</p>

defeat.</p>
<p>ODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4 stands in front of
the engine and is sucked in, causing the engine to die.</p>
<p>DUM-4 is spit out the back of the engine, very bent up. The engine lets out
one final wheeze, then EXPLODES in a puff of smoke.</p>

<p>Sure enough, coming around the bend is ANAKIN, quickly gaining on the pack.
The two-headed announcer describes the action. The crowd goes wild.</p>
<p>FODE/BEED: (O.S.)</p>
<p>BEED: It looks like Skywalker is moving up in the field...</p>
<p>ANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is
unbearable.</p>
<p>EXT MOS ESPA - ARENA - PIT AREA - DAY (FX)</p>
<p>KITSTER and WALD cheer as ANAKIN passes.</p>
<p>ARTOO lets out an excited whistle.</p>
<p>THREEPIO: He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear!</p>
<p>Lap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The crowd stands and
YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the distance.</p>
<p>EXT MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)</p>
<p>ANAKIN is powering around corners and over hills and cliffs, passing other
racers right and left. SEBULBA is in the lead. He is being challenged by another
racer, XELBREE.</p>
<p>SEBULBA slows a little, and as XELBREE pulls alongside, he opens a side vent
on the racer's engine and the exhaust starts to cut through the alien's engine.</p>
<p>The blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES. SEBULBA deftly
veers away.</p>
<p>FODE/BEED: (O.S.)</p>
<p>BEED: Oh, I don't care what universe you're from, that's gotta hurt.</p>
<p>ANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they zoom over a dune
sea, kicking up dust. His Pod shakes violently as he goes over a jump. Tusken
Raiders continue to shoot at the podracers. One of the Podracers, ODY, is hit by
a blaster bolt and the whole thing EXPLODES.</p>
<p>EXT MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY</p>
<p>QUI-GON, SHMI, PADME and JAR JAR continue to look fo ANAKIN.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Here he comes, yahoo!</p>
<p>FODE/BEED: (O.S.)</p>
<p>BEED: At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely
followed by Skywalker...</p>
<p>ANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck over the rough
terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes through the
arena.</p>
<p>EXT MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)</p>
<p>SEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin's engines.
ANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is forced off course.</p>
<p>FODE/BEED: (O.S.)</p>
<p>BEED: Skywalker's been forced onto the service ramp!</p>
<p>On a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead.</p>
<p>FODE BEED: (O.S.)</p>
<p>BEED: It's Skywalker!</p>
<p>The crowd goes wild.</p>
<p>FODE BEED: (O.S.)</p>
<p>BEED: (cont'd) Amazing... a quick controlled thrust and he's back on course!</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Did he crashed?</p>
<p>SEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on Anakin's tail, crowding him and
pushing him through the turns. SEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy
has a difficult time keeping control.</p>
<p>Two JAWA are watching from a distance.</p>
<p>One of the parts on Anakin's engines begins to shake loose.</p>
<p>FODE BEED: (O.S.)</p>
<p>BEED: Skywalker's in trouble. Sebulba takes the lead.</p>
<p>ANAKIN sees the problem and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is
trying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.</p>
<p>ANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,
SEBULBA is able to block.</p>
<p>Finally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries
to go around SEBULBA on the outside. They race side by side down the final
stretch of the track.</p>
<p>FODE/BEED: (O.S.)</p>
<p>BEED: He's catching Sebulba.</p>
<p>FODE: Inkabunga.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Careful, Ani, careful, Ani!</p>
<p>SEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN
over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering rods
on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.</p>
<p>FODE/BEED: (O.S.)</p>
<p>BEED: That little human being is out of his mind.</p>
<p>FODE: Punda tah punda!</p>
<p>BEED: They're side by side!</p>
<p>FODE: Bongo du bongu!</p>
<p>As they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering rods
by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is
tremendous. The release of tension sends SEBULBA into a spin as he crashes. One
engine EXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids and slides to a smoking stop. He
slams his fists against his pod in discust.</p>
<p>SEBULBA: Poodu!</p>
<p>ANAKIN flies by as the crowd stands, CHERRING. QUI-GON, SHMI and PADME smile.
JAR JAR gets excited. WALD and KITSTER jump up and down in excitment. ARTOO
whistles hysterically.</p>

QUI-GON simply smiles.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you'll lose. Bring the

<p>WATTO: You can't have him! It wasn't a fair bet!</p>

Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Yes. Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: You mean I get to come with you in your starship?!</p>
<p>QUI-GON kneels down to the boy.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Anakin, training to become a Jedi is not be a easy challenge. And if

swund a death blow with his laser sword that is barely blocked by QUI-GON.</p>

<p>INT NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT</p>
<p>NUTE sits in a strange, mechanical walking chair, which moves beside SIO
BIBBLE. A group of armed GUARD DROIDS march behind them.</p>
<p>NUTE: Your Queen is lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are
going to die, much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>BIBBLE: This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people
have decided...</p>
<p>NUTE: Take him away.</p>
<p>BIBBLE is taken away as OOM-9 approaches NUTE.</p>
<p>OOM-9: My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these
rumored underwater villages... they will not stay hidden for long.</p>
<p>INT NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA</p>
<p>The ship is asleep. The lights are dim as PADME walks into the main room. She
goes to a monitor and watches the BIBBLE plea recording. JAR JAR is stretched
out in a chair, snoring. ARTOO is to one side, cooing as he rests.</p>
<p>PADME appears tired. She senses someone watching her and turns around with a
start. She sees ANAKIN sitting in the corner, shivering and looking very
dejected.</p>
<p>PADME: Are you all right?</p>
<p>ANAKIN: It's very cold.</p>
<p>She goes over to him. He looks up at her with tears in his eyes. He is
holding his arms to keep himself warm. PADME gives him her over-jacket.</p>
<p>PADME: You come from a warm planet, Annie. A little too warm for my taste.
Space is cold.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: You seem sad.</p>
<p>PADME: The Queen is... worried. Her people are suffering... dying. She must
convince the Senate to intervene, I'm not sure what will happen.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: (he pulls something from his pocket) I made this for you. So you'd
remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will bring you good
fortune.</p>
<p>ANAKIN hands a wooden pendant to PADME. She inspects it, then puts it around
her neck.</p>
<p>PADME: It's beautiful, but I don't need this to remember you by. Many things
will change when we reach the capital, Ani. My caring for you will remain.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I care for you too. Only I...</p>
<p>ANAKIN is disturbed about something. Tears are in his eyes.</p>
<p>PADME: ...Miss your mother.</p>
<p>ANAKIN looks at her, unable to speak. She hugs him.</p>

the galaxy.</p>
<p>INT NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT</p>
<p>ANAKIN looks out the cockpit window in awe.</p>
<p>RIC OLIE: Coruscant... the entire planet is one big city. There's Chancellor
Valorum's shuttle. And look over there, Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.</p>

<p>EXT CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - DAY</p>
<p>Supreme Chancellor VALORUM, SEVERAL GUARDS, and SENATOR PALPATINE stand on a
landing platform.</p>
<p>The sleek Naboo spacecraft lands on the platform high above the street level
of the galactic capital. The ramp lowers. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, JAR JAR and ANAKIN
descend the ramp first and bow before PALPATINE and VALORUM.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, QUEEN AMIDALA, then PADME, RABE, EIRTAE, and MORE
GUARDS descend the ramp. QUEEN AMIDALA stops before the group.ANAKIN and JAR JAR
stand to one side, looking at the huge city. PADME smiles at ANAKIN. PALPATINE
bows before the Queen.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. With the
communications breakdown, we've become very concerned. I'm anxious to hear your
report on the situation. May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.</p>
<p>VALORUM: Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honor to finally meet you in person.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.</p>
<p>VALORUM: (cont'd) I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the
currant situation. I've called for a special session of the Senate to hear your
position.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor.</p>
<p>PALPATINE starts to lead QUEEN AMIDALA and her RETINUE off the platform
toward a waiting air taxi.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can
overcome it...</p>
<p>JAR JAR and ANAKIN follow the QUEEN, PALPATINE, PADME, RABE and EIRTAE to the
taxi.</p>
<p>QUI-GON and OBI-WAN stop to speak with VALORUM as they watch the group head
towards the taxi.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I must speak with the Jedi Council immediately. The situation has
become more complicated.</p>
<p>INT PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - ANTEROOM - DAY</p>
<p>QUEEN AMIDALA is sitting listening to PALPATINE. EIRTAE and RABE stand behind
the QUEEN; PADME is nowhere to be seen. ANAKIN and JAR JAR are waiting in an
adjoining room. They can see the Queen but cannot hear what is being said.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN PANAKA enters, then goes into the room with QUEEN AMIDALA.</p>
<p>INT PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - LIVING AREA - DAY</p>
<p>PALPATINE is pacing as CAPTAIN PANAKA enters. EIRTAE and RABE stand to one
side.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: ...the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of
greedy, squabbling delegates. There is no interest in the common good. I must be
frank, Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real
power... he is mired by baseless accusations of corruption. The bureaucrats are
in charge now.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: What options have we?</p>
<p>PALPATINE: Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger
Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, and give us
justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: He has been our strongest supporter?</p>
<p>PALPATINE: Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the
courts...</p>
<p>AMIDALA: The courts take even longer to decide things than the Senate. Our
people are dying, Senator... We must do something quickly to stop the
Federation.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: To be realistic, Your Majesty, I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control for the time being.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: That is something I cannot do.</p>
<p>EXT TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - DAY (FX)</p>
<p>A unique building with it tall spires stands out against the Coruscant
skyline. A small transport passes by the vast temple.</p>
<p>INT TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY</p>
<p>QUI-GON stands in a tall stately room. Twelve JEDI sit in a semi-circle.
OBI-WAN stands behind QUI-GON in the center of the room.</p>
<p>The Senior Jedi is MACE WINDU. To his left is an alien Jedi named
KI-ADI-MUNDI, and to his right, the Jedi Master, YODA.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: ... He was trained in the Jedi arts. My only conclusion can be that
it was a Sith Lord.</p>
<p>KI-ADI: Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium.</p>
<p>MACE WINDU: I do not believe the Sith could have returned without us knowing.</p>
<p>YODA: Ah, hard to see, the dark side is.</p>
<p>MACE WINDU: We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and
discover the identity of your attacker... May the Force be with you.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN turns and leaves, but QUI-GON continues to face the Council.</p>
<p>YODA: (Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: With your permission, my Master. I have encountered a vergence in
the Force.</p>
<p>YODA: A vergence, you say?</p>
<p>MACE WINDU: Located around a person?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: A boy... his cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians
I have ever seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians.</p>
<p>MACE WINDU: You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring
balance to the Force... you believe it's this boy??</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I don't presume...</p>
<p>YODA: But you do! Revealed your opinion is.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I request the boy be tested, Master.</p>
<p>The JEDI all look to one another. They nod and turn back to OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON.</p>
<p>YODA: Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Finding him was the will of the Force... I have no doubt of that.</p>
<p>MACE WINDU: Bring him before us, then.</p>
<p>INT QUEENS QUARTERS - CORUSCANT - DAY</p>
<p>Anakin, tentative, walks down one of the long hallways in Senator Palpatine's
quarters. He stops before a door that is flanked by a GUARD.</p>
<p>The GUARD speaks into his comlink as ANAKIN looks around a bit nervously.</p>
<p>GUARD: The boy is here to see Padme.</p>
<p>RABE: (v.o.) Let him in.</p>
<p>The doors open, and ANAKIN enters the Queen's quarters.</p>
<p>RABE greets ANAKIN as TWO OTHER HANDMAIDENS come and go into the next room.</p>
<p>RABE: I'm sorry, Ani, but Padme is not here right now.</p>
<p>The Queen speaks out in the next room.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: (O.S.) Who is it?</p>
<p>RABE: Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness.</p>
<p>The QUEEN moves into the doorway and studies ANAKIN. ANAKIN bows and looks
down, then takes a peek at her.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: I've sent Padme on an errand.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I'm on my way to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope.</p>
<p>The QUEEN just stares at him.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: (Cont'd) I may not see her again... so... I came to say goodbye.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: We will tell her for you. We are sure her heart goes with you.</p>
<p>ANAKIN bows again.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Thank you, Your Highness.</p>
<p>The QUEEN dissapears behind the doorway, and ANAKIN exits.</p>
<p>EXT CORUSCANT - GALACTIC SENATE BUILDING - DAY (FX)</p>
<p>A large, distinctive looking domed building stands out amid the cityscape of
Coruscant.</p>
<p>INT MAIN ROTUNDA - GALACTIC SENATE - DAY</p>
<p>The Senate chambers are huge. Thousands of SENATORS and their AIDES sit in
the circular assembly area. CHANCELLOR VALORUM sits in an elevated area in the
center. SENATOR PALPATINE, QUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in
the Naboo congressional box, which is actually a floating platform.</p>
<p>VALORUM: The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of Naboo.</p>
<p>The Naboo congressional box floats into the center.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has
occurred which started with the taxation of trade routes, and has now engulfed
our entire planet in the oppression of the Trade Federation.</p>
<p>A second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is filled with
Federation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the Senator for the Federation.</p>
<p>LOTT DOD: This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!</p>
<p>VALORUM: The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade Federation
at this time. Please return to your station.</p>
<p>LOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, recently
elected ruler of Naboo, who speaks on our behalf.</p>
<p>QUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is some applause.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: Honorable representatives of the Republic, I come to you under the
gravest of circumstances. Naboo system has been invaded by the droid armies of
the Trade...</p>
<p>LOTT DOD: I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a
commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth.</p>
<p>A third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS
MOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.</p>
<p>AKS MOE: The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from
the Trade Federation. A commission must be appointed.</p>
<p>VALORUM: The point...</p>
<p>VALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA.
PALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the
payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will dissapear.</p>
<p>VALORUM: The point is conceded ... will you defer your motion to allow a
commission to explore the validity of your accusations?</p>
<p>QUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: (angrily) I will not defer... I have come before you to resolve this
attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and
die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable
of action, I suggest new leadership is needed... I move for a "vote of no
confidence"... in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.</p>
<p>This causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud murmur cresendos into a roar
of approval and jeers.</p>
<p>ASSEMBLY: Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!</p>
<p>CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands back, speechless. His Vice Chair,
MAS AMEDDA, takes over.</p>
<p>MAS AMEDDA: Order!</p>
<p>Things settledown a little. The Federation box settles next to AMIDALA.</p>
<p>PALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: Now they will elect a new Chancellor, a strong Chancellor, one who
will not let our tragedy continue...</p>
<p>EXT PALACE OF THE JEDI - BALCONY - SUNSET</p>
<p>OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand outside the palace on a balcony.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master. He's too old.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Anakin will become a Jedi ... I promise you.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Do not defy the Council, Master... not again.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: If you would just follow the code you would be on the council. They
will not go along with you this time.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.</p>
<p>INT PALACE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - SUNSET</p>
<p>ANAKIN stands before the TWELVE JEDI. MACE WINDU holds a small hand-held
viewing screen. In rapid succession, images flash across the screen.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: A ship... a cup... a ship... a speeder.</p>
<p>MACE WINDU turns the viewing screen off and nods toward YODA.</p>
<p>YODA: Hmm... how feel you?</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Cold, sir.</p>
<p>YODA: Afraid are you?</p>
<p>ANAKIN: No, sir.</p>
<p>YODA: See through you, we can.</p>
<p>MACE WINDU: Be mindful of your feelings...</p>
<p>KI-ADI: Your thoughts dwell on your mother.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I miss her.</p>
<p>YODA: Afraid to lose her... I think, hmm?</p>
<p>ANAKIN: (a little angry) What's that got to do with anything?</p>
<p>YODA: Everything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger...
anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering... I sense much fear in you.</p>
<p>INT PALPATINES QUARTERS - SUNSET</p>
<p>QUEEN AMIDALA is standing, staring out the window, with JAR JAR. The lights
of the city shimmer before them. EIRTAE and SABE stand near the door. JAR JAR
turns to face the QUEEN and sees her sadness.</p>

<p>PALPATINE and CAPTAIN PANAKA rush into the room and bow before the QUEEN.</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: Your Highness? Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has been
nominated to succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. Your Majesty, if I am
elected, I promise put an end to corruption.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: Who else can be nominated?</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ailee Teem of Malastare.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: I feel confident ... our "situation" will create a
strong sympathy vote for us ... I will be Chancellor.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator,
there will be nothing left of our our people, our way of life...</p>
<p>PALPATINE: I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the
Federation has possession of our planet.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I've
decided to go back to Naboo.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! They'll force you to
sign the treaty.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different from
that of our people. Captain!</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: Your Highness?</p>
<p>AMIDALA: Ready my ship!</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: Please, Your Majesty, stay here... where it's safe.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions. I pray
you will bring sanity and compassion back to the Senate.</p>

<p>KI-ADI: The Force is strong with him.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: He's to be trained, then?</p>
<p>The COUNCIL MEMBERS look to one another.</p>
<p>MACE WINDU: No. He will not be trained.</p>
<p>ANAKIN is crestfallen and stares at MACE.</p>
<p>MACE WINDU: He is too old.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: He is the chosen one... you must see it.</p>
<p>YODA: Clouded, this boy's future is.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I will train him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN reacts with surprise. ANAKIN watches with interest.</p>
<p>YODA: An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.</p>
<p>MACE WINDU: The code forbids it.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Obi-Wan is ready...</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: I am ready to face the trials.</p>
<p>YODA: Our own council we will keep on who is ready.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: He is headstrong and he has much to learn of the living Force, but
he is capable. There is little more he can learn from me.</p>
<p>YODA: Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.</p>
<p>MACE WINDU: Now is not the time for this... the Senate is voting for a new
Supreme Chancellor and Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure
on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation.</p>
<p>KI-ADI: And draw out the Queen's attacker.</p>
<p>MACE WINDU: Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the dark
warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith.</p>
<p>YODA: May the Force be with you.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN bow then leave.</p>
<p>EXT CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - NIGHT</p>
<p>QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and ANAKIN stand on the landing platform outside the ship.
ARTOO whistles a happy tune. The wind whips at ANAKIN as he listens to the JEDI.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: From your point of view....</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: The boy is dangerous... they all sense it. Why can't you?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: His fate is uncertain, he's not dangerous. The Council will decide
Anakin's future... that should be enough for you. Now get on board!</p>
<p>OBI-WAN reluctantly boards the Naboo spacecraft. QUI-GON goes over to ANAKIN
who is standing next to ARTOO.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Master Qui-Gon, sir, I don't want to be a problem.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: You won't be, Ani... I'm not allowed to train you, so I want you to
watch me and be mindful...</p>
<p>ARTOO turns and rolls over to the edge of the platform watching the trafic.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: (cont'd) ... always remember, your focus determines your reality.
Stay close to me and you will be safe.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Master, sir... I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians. I've been
wondering, what are midi-chlorians?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all
living cells.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: They live inside of me?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: In your cells, yes... and we are symbionts with them.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Symbionts?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the Force. They
continually speak to us, telling us the will of the Force. When you learn to
quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to you.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: I don't understand.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: With time and training, Ani... you will... you will.</p>
<p>Two taxis pull up, and CAPTAIN PANAKA, QUEEN AMIDALA, and her HANDMAIDENS
stop before the JEDI.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: (Cont'd) Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to continue to serve and
protect you.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears the Federation means to
destroy me.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: I assure you, I will not let that happen.</p>
<p>AMIDALA enters the ship, followed by her HANDMAIDENS. JAR JAR hugs QUI-GON

<p>QUI-GON: Good.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand silently for a moment.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Do you think the Queen's idea will work?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and we cannot use our power
to help her.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: I'm... I'm sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place to
disagree with you about the boy... and I am grateful you think I am ready to
take the trials.</p>
<p>QUI-GON looks at him for a long moment.</p>

<p>AMIDALA: I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo... I come before you in peace.</p>
<p>BOSS NASS: Ah, Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks... Yousa all bombad.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN PANAKA and HALF A DOZEN GUARDS and PILOTS look around nervously, and
the GUNGAN TROOPS lower their long power poles. The JEDI stay relaxed. ANAKIN
watches everything with great interest.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: We have searched you out 'cause we wish to form an alliance...</p>
<p>Suddenly, PADME steps forward.</p>
<p>PADME: Your Honor...</p>

<p>PADME: I am Queen Amidala.</p>
<p>JAR JAR and ANAKIN are stunned.</p>
<p>PADME: (points to Queen) This is my decoy...

<p>OBI-WAN and QUI-GON give each other a knowing look.</p>
<p>PADME: (Cont'd) ... I am sorry for my deception, but it was necessary to
protect myself. Although we do not always agree, Your Honor, our two great
societies have always lived in peace. The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build. If we do not act quickly, all will be lost
forever... I ask you to help us... (PADME drops to her knees before the GUNGANS.)...
no, I beg you to help us. We are your humble servants...</p>
<p>There is a gasp from CAPTAIN PANAKA, HIS TROOPS, and the HANDMAIDENS.</p>
<p>PADME: (Cont'd) ... Our fate is in your hands.</p>
<p>Slowly, CAPTAIN PANAKA and his TROOPS bow down before the GUNGAN COUNCIL.
Then the HANDMAIDENS, ANAKIN, and finally the JEDI. The GUNGANS are puzzled by
this. BOSS NASS begins to laugh.</p>
<p>BOSS NASS: Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis.</p>

ANAKIN at the foot of the statue.</p>
<p>GUNGAN LOOKOUT: Daza comen!</p>
<p>ANAKIN: All right...</p>
<p>ANAKIN yells and runs over to PADME and the JEDI, who are discussing a battle
plan with FIVE GUNGAN GENERALS.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: (cont'd) ... They're here.</p>
<p>PADME: Good, they made it.</p>
<p>THREE SPEEDERS pull up to the GROUP. CAPTAIN PANAKA and a DOZEN OR SO GUARDS

<p>JAR JAR: General??! Oh, no..</p>
<p>JAR JAR's eyes roll back, his tongue flops out and he faints.</p>
<p>BOSS NASS laughs and walks over to where CAPTAIN PANAKA is talking with PADME
and the JEDI.</p>
<p>PADME: What is the situation?</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and
guards have formed an underground resistance movement. I brought back as many of
the leaders as I could. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought,
and much stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.</p>
<p>PADME: The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the Droid Army
away from the cities. (to Artoo) Artoo, we can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Panaka
will create a diversion. Then we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy.
Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.</p>
<p>QUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.</p>
<p>PADME: (Cont'd) What do you think, Master Jedi?</p>
<p>QUI-GON: The Viceroy will be well guarded.</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: The difficulty's getting into the throne room. Once
we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: There is a possibility, with this diversion many, Gungans
will be killed.</p>
<p>BOSS NASS: Wesa ready to do are-sa part.</p>
<p>ANAKIN watches with interest.</p>
<p>PADME: We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will
send what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship orbiting the
planet.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The
weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: And there's an even bigger danger. If the Viceroy escapes,
Your Highness, he will return with another droid army.</p>
<p>PADME: Well that is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy.
Everything depends on it.</p>

<p>All is peaceful. Suddenly there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake. A
rush of bubbles, then a GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU emerges from the fog,
followed by SEVERAL OTHERS.</p>
<p>SOLDIERS on huge, lizard-like FAMBAAS with large shield generators mounted on
their backs follow the marching WARRIORS.</p>
<p>The GUNGAN ARMY heads out of the swamp and onto the rolling grassy hills.
HUNDREDS OF GUNGAN WARRIORS march in lon lines toward the horizon.</p>
<p>The GUNGAN, GENERAL CEEL, sees the tanks on the ridge and orders a halt. The
GUNGANS are spread out in a large line. JAR JAR is nervous.</p>
<p>GENERAL CEEL signals to the shield operators.</p>
<p>GENERAL CEEL: Halt! Starten up the shield.</p>
<p>A red ray shoots out of the generator and blasts into a large dish on the
back of a second FAMBAA and spreads like an umbrella over the assembled
WARRIORS.</p>
<p>Federation tanks move up to a ridge and stop. In the distance they see the
GUNGAN ARMY waiting for them.</p>

<p>PADME, followed by EIRTAE, OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, ANAKIN, and ARTOO, stealthily
makes her way toward the entrance to the main hanger. They are followed by about
TWENTY NABOO GUARDS, PILOTS, and TROOPS. They stop, and PADME uses a small red
laser light to signal across the plaza to CAPTAIN PANAKA, RABE and TWENTY OTHER
ASSORTED NABOO TROOPS. They signal back. QUI-GON leans over to ANAKIN.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Once we get inside, you find a safe place to hide and stay
there.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Sure.</p>
<p>QUI-GON points a stern finger at ANAKIN.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: (cont'd) Stay there!</p>
<p>DROID TROOPS mill about the tank-filled plaza. At the far end of the plaza,
SEVERAL DROIDS begin to run and fire. NABOO SOLDIERS begin to fire back at the
BATTLE DROIDS.</p>
<p>As the ruckus erupts at one end of the plaza, PADME and her TROOPS rush into
the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS SOLDIERS continue to engage the DROIDS

signals to her pilots.</p>
<p>PADME: Get to your ships!</p>
<p>The PILOTS and ARTOO UNITS run for the Naboo fighter craft stacked in the
hanger bay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ship begins to levitate out of the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS fire at it as it
falls in behind five other fighters. ARTOO whistles to ANAKIN from a fighter not
far away. ANAKIN runs and jumps into the fighter to hide.</p>

<p>The GUNGANS continue to wait as they see the doors to the massive transports
open, and racks of BATTLE DROIDS are pulled out and lined up.</p>

<p>She looks to QUI-GON.</p>

<p>They start to head for the exit, on the way passing the fighter where ANAKIN
is hiding. ARTOO whistles a greeting as ANAKIN peeps out of the cockpit.</p>

<p>QUI-GON: Anakin, stay where you are. You'll be safe there.</p>
<p>ANAKNI: But, I...</p>

<p>They head for the exit. As they are about to go through the door, suddenly
everyone halts, revealing DARTH MAUL standing in the doorway. CAPTAIN PANAKA,
PADME, and HER TROOPS back away. QUI-GON and OBI-WAN step forward.</p>

the sword light up.</p>

<p>The DROIDS begin to advance and start firing on PADME and HER TROOPS.</p>
<p>ARTOO whistles a reply. Suddenly, the ship's systems go on, and the ship
begins to levitate.</p>

<p>ANAKIN pushes a button, and the ship begins to roll towards the DROIDS.</p>

a DROID jumps on him. He drops the DROID and gets caught up in the DROIDS
wiring, dragging the torso around with him, the DROID's gun firing randomly, accidentally
blasting SEVERAL DROIDS in one process.</p>

<p>Three swords are crossed in an intense display of swordsmanship. The JEDI and
the SITH LORD fight their way across the narrow bridge of the Theed power
generator. The laser sword battle continues on the small catwalk around the vast
power pit. DARTH MAUL kicks OBI-WAN off one of the ramps and he falls several
levels. QUI-GON knocks the DARK LORD off another ramp, and he lands hard on a
ramp two levels below. QUI-GON jumps down after him. The DARK LORD backs away
along the catwalk into a small door. QUI-GON follows as OBI-WAN leaps up and
runs to join QUI-GON in battle.</p>

<p>The SITH LORD, followed by QUI-GON, enters a long hallway filled with a
series of deadly rays that go on and off in a pulsing pattern that shoots down
the corridor every minute or so. DARTH MAUL makes it down several walls of
deadly rays before they close. QUI-GON is one wall away from the DARK LORD.
OBI-WAN is just starting into it and is five walls way from DARTH MAUL. The JEDI
must wait until the next pulse to advance down the corridor. OBI-WAN is
impatient and paces, waiting for the wall of rays to open. QUI-GON sits and
meditates. DARTH MAUL hits the wall with the blade of his laser sword causing it
to short out temporarily.</p>

<p>The GUNGAN ARMY is no match for the DESTROYER DROIDS. A DESTROYER DROID
blasts one of the shield generators, causing it to EXPLODE. The protective
shield begins to weaken and fall apart. The GUNGAN GENERAL signals a retreat as
the tanks enter the battle.</p>
<p>The GUNGANS flee as fast as they can. JAR JAR mutters something in a panic as
he runs for cover under a wagon.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Dis is nuttsen.</p>
<p>The driver of the wagon starts to leave, uncovering JAR JAR.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: O, oh.</p>
<p>He attempts to escape on the wagon of energy balls but only manages to
unhitch the back gate, causing all of the energy balls to roll out of the wagon
and down the hill.</p>
<p>The GUNGANS renew their attack on the DROID ARMY. JAR JAR's bumbling destroys
several more DESTROYER DROIDS. JAR JAR scrambles to avoid being hit by one of
the balls. A TANK isn't so lucky.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Hey, hey! Gimme a lift.</p>
<p>A GUNGANS riding by on a KAADU picks up JAR JAR.</p>
<p>An explosion hits the GUNGAN and JAR JAR is blown off his KAADU and lands on
one of the tank guns. JAR JAR is scared.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN TARPALS pulls an energy ball out of his pouch.</p>

<p>The GUNGAN throws JAR JAR an electric ball. JAR JAR struggles to catch it and
it lands in the face of DROID in control of the tank.</p>
<p>The tank looses control and vears off to the left digging a path in the

LORD. They move into the area at the end of the corridor called the melting pit,
a small area that is mostly made up of a deep hole.</p>
<p>The electron ray gates begin to close. OBI-WAN tries to make it to the
melting pit but is caught one gate short. He slides to a stop just before he
hits the deadly electron field.</p>
<p>QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL battle around the melting pit as a frustrated OBI-WAN
watches.</p>
<p>DARTH MAUL catches QUI-GON off guard. The SITH makes a quick move, bashes his
lightsaber handle into QUI-GON's chin, and runs his lightsaber through his
mid-section. QUI-GON slumps to the floor in a heap.</p>

<p>OBI-WAN slices through the center of THE DARK LORD's laser sword and he
looses half.</p>
<p>The JEDI flips as DARTH MAUL gets up to continue the fight.</p>
<p>As OBI-WAN grows weary, he is kicked in the chin by the DARK LORD.</p>
<p>The TWO continue to fight DARTH MAUL FORCE THROWS OBI-WAN into a melting pit.
He is barely able to hold onto a nozzle on the side of the pit. DARTH MAUL grins
evilly at OBI-WAN as he kicks OBI-WAN's lightsaber down the endless shaft.</p>
<p>INT NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - FEDERATION HANGER</p>
<p>ARTOO whistles.</p>
<p>ANAKIN sees the dashboard lights go from red to green.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Yes! We have power. Shields up.</p>
<p>ANAKIN flips a switch and the ship levitates, knocking over the BATTLE DROID
CAPTAIN. The OTHER DROIDS shoot, but the lasers are deflected by ANAKIN's
shields. ARTOO beeps.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Take this!...</p>
<p>ANAKIN fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: (cont'd)... and this!</p>
<p>He presses a button and launches two torpedoes which miss the DROIDS.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Woa!</p>
<p>The two torpedoes fly down a hallway and explode inside the reactor room.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Oops.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</p>
<p>TEY HOW turns to CAPTAIN DOFINE.</p>
<p>TEY HOW: Sir, we're losing power... There seems to be a problem with
the main reactor...</p>
<p>DOFINE: Impossible!! Nothing can get through our shield.</p>
<p>INT NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - FEDERATION HANGER</p>
<p>ANAKIN continues to fire, maneuvering the ship towards the exit.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Let's get out of here.</p>
<p>ARTOO beeps in agreement.</p>
<p>INT NABOO FIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE</p>
<p>RIC OLIE watches in amazement as the Federation battleship starts to explode
from the inside out.</p>
<p>BRAVO TWO: What's that?? It's blowing up from the inside.</p>
<p>RIC OLIE: We didn't hit it.</p>
<p>INT NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - FEDERATION HANGER</p>
<p>ANAKIN's ship roars through the hanger deck, bouncing over the DROIDS.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: (Cont'd) Now, this is Podracing!</p>
<p>INT NABOO FIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE</p>
<p>A lone NABOO FIGHTER comes into view.</p>
<p>BRAVO THREE: Look! One of ours! Outta the main hold!!</p>
<p>ANAKIN: Whoo, hoo!</p>
<p>All the pilots start to cheer and laugh in ANAKIN's excitement.</p>
<p>INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</p>
<p>The bridge explodes as DOFINE and TEY HOW look for a way to escape.</p>
<p>EXT NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY</p>
<p>Suddenly, all of the DROIDS begin to shake upside down, run around in
circles, then stop. The GUNGANS carefully move out to inspect the FROZEN DROIDS.
JAR JAR pushes one of the BATTLE DROIDS, and it falls over.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Whatsen dey doin?</p>
<p>CAPT. TARPALS: The control ship has been destroyed. Look!</p>
<p>He pushes one over to show what he means.</p>
<p>JAR JAR: Dey all broken.</p>
<p>The GUNGANS cheer.</p>
<p>INT THEED - POWER GENERATOR - MELTING PIT</p>
<p>The SITH LORD smiles as he goes in for the kill. At the last moment, OBI-WAN
jumps up out of the pit, calls QUI-GON's lightsaber to him, throwing DARTH MAUL
off. The young JEDI swings with a vengeance, cutting the SITH down. DARTH MAUL
falls into the melting pit to his death.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN rushes over to QUI-GON, who is dying.</p>
<p>QUI-GON: It is too late... It's...</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: No!</p>
<p>QUI-GON: Obi-Wan promise ... promise me you'll train the boy...</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Yes, Master...</p>
<p>QUI-GON: He is the chosen one... he will... bring balance... train
him!</p>
<p>QUI-GON dies. OBI-WAN cradles his Master, quietly weeping.</p>
<p>INT MAIN HANGER - COURTYARD - DAY</p>
<p>The large, grand cruiser of the Supreme Chancellor lands in the courtyard of
the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and TWENTY TROOPS guard NUTE GUNRAY and RUNE
HAAKO. OBI-WAN, the QUEEN, and her HANDMAIDENS stand before the NEIMOIDIANS.</p>
<p>PADME: Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go back to the Senate
and explain all this.</p>
<p>CAPT. PANAKA: I think you can kiss your Trade franchise goodbye.</p>
<p>The main ramp of the cruiser is lowered as OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA lead
the VICEROY and HIS ASSISTANT toward the ship. The GRAND CHANCELLOR PALPATINE
and SEVERAL REPUBLIC GUARDS descend the walkway, followed by YODA and SEVERAL
OTHER JEDI MASTERS.</p>
<p>The CHANCELLOR PALPATINE walks up to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. The JEDI bow before
him.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: (to Obi-Wan) We are indebted to you for your bravery,
Obi-Wan Kenobi. (to Anakin) And you, young Skywalker, we will watch your career
with great interest.</p>
<p>The CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is greeted by the QUEEN.</p>
<p>AMIDALA: Congratulations on your election, Chancellor.</p>
<p>PALPATINE: Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty. It is you
who should be congratulated. Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the
Republic.</p>
<p>INT. TURRET ROOM - NABOO PALACE - LATE DAY</p>
<p>The sun streams into the multi-windowed room at a low angle. It is not quite
sunset. YODA paces before OBI-WAN, who is kneeling in the center of the room.</p>
<p>YODA: Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Council does. But
agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Qui-Gon believed in him.</p>
<p>YODA: The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear
in his training.</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin.
Without the approval of the Council if I must.</p>
<p>YODA: Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree
with you, the council does. Your apprentice, Skywalker will be.</p>
<p>EXT THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - FUNERAL TEMPLE STEPS - SUNSET</p>
<p>QUI-GON's body goes up in flames as the JEDI COUNCIL, the QUEEN, SIO BIBBLE,
CAPTAIN PANAKA, the HANDMAIDENS, and ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NABOO TROOPES, TWENTY
OTHER JEDI, PALPATINE, OBI-WAN (standing with ANAKIN), JAR JAR, BOSS NASS, and
TWENTY OTHER GUNGAN WARRIORS watch. There is a drum roll that stops. Doves are
released, and the body is gone. ANAKIN looks to OBI-WAN.</p>
<p>ANAKIN: What will happen to me now?</p>
<p>OBI-WAN: The Council has granted me permission to train you. You will
be a Jedi, I promise.</p>
<p>To one side, MACE WINDU turns to YODA.</p>
<p>MACE WINDU: There's no doubt. The mysterious warrior was a Sith.</p>
<p>YODA: Always two there are.... no more... no less. A master and an
apprentice.</p>
<p>MACE WINDU: But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice?</p>
<p>They give each other a concerned look as the camera pans over to PALPATINE.</p>
<p>EXT THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY</p>
<p>CHILDEREN SING and throw flowers on the passing GUNGAN SOLDIERS. The CROWDS
CHEER. It is a grand parade.</p>
<p>QUEEN AMIDALA stands next to the SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE, ANAKIN,
OBI-WAN, SIO BIBBLE, and the JEDI COUNCIL. ARTOO stands in front of the QUEEN'S
HANDMAIDENS and whistles at the parade. QUEEN AMIDALA and PALPATINE smile at one
another.</p>
<p>In the parade are BOSS NASS and his GUARDS, JAR JAR and GENERAL CEEL. The
GUNGANS ride KAADU. They stop before the QUEEN and walk up the steps to stand by
her side. BOSS NASS holds up the Globe of Peace.</p>
<p>BOSS NASS: Peace!</p>
<p>EVERYONE CHEERS. The parade marches on. AMIDALA looks over at ANAKIN and
smiles.</p>
